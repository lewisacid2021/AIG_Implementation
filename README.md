# AIG_Implementation
A simple implementation of AIG in cpp

## How to build？

Use bash command or CMake Tools:

```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

If all goes well, the resulting binary executable `read_aig` will be placed in the "bin" subdirectory. 

## Run Test

Ensure you are in the root directory and execute the test script using 

```bash
    python3 test.py
```
